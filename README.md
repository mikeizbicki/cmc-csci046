## Collaboration Policy

You are encouraged to discuss all labs, homeworks, and online quizzes with other students,
subject to the following constraints:

1. you must be the person typing in all code for your assignments, and
1. you must not copy another student's code.

You may use any online resources you like as references.

## Accommodations for Disabilities

I want you to succeed and I'll make every effort to ensure that you can.
If you need any accommodations, please ask.

If you have already established accommodations with Disability Services at CMC, please communicate your approved accommodations to me at your earliest convenience so we can discuss your needs in this course. You can start this conversation by forwarding me your accommodation letter. If you have not yet established accommodations through Disability Services, but have a temporary health condition or permanent disability (conditions include but are not limited to: mental health, attention-related, learning, vision, hearing, physical or health), you are encouraged to contact Assistant Dean for Disability Services & Academic Success, Kari Rood, at disabilityservices@cmc.edu to ask questions and/or begin the process. General information and the Request for Accommodations form can be found at the CMC DOS Disability Service’s website. Please note that arrangements must be made with advance notice in order to access the reasonable accommodations. You are able to request accommodations from CMC Disability Services at any point in the semester. Be mindful that this process may take some time to complete and accommodations are not retroactive. It is important to Claremont McKenna College to create inclusive and accessible learning environments consistent with federal and state law. If you are not a CMC student, please connect with the Disability Services Coordinator on your campus regarding a similar process.
