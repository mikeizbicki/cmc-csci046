# Github Tutorial

After following [these seven steps](https://jarv.is/notes/how-to-pull-request-fork-github/), the typo is fixed!

(And we are at a new branch)

<!--
The basic procedure for contributing a change to a project on github is as follows:

1. Fork the project
1. Make changes to the forked project
1. Submit a "pull request" to the original project

The maintainer of the original project then reviews the changes and decides whether to accept or reject the pull request.

In this tutorial, you will learn how to integrate git with github.
Github is a website for hosting git repos.
Many others exist (e.g. bitbucket and gitlab),
but github is the most popular and so it is what we will use in this class.
The techniques for using the other services are essentially the same.

##

Use the official github documentation to:

1. If you don't already have a github account, create one by [clicking here](https://github.com/join).
   You may use any username you want for the account, and it does not have to match your CMC account.
   I recommend using your full name, if it is available, as this account can serve as a "portfolio" for when you apply to jobs in the future.
   
1. Create a new repo by following [these official github instructions](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-new-repository).
   You should call your repo `firstrepo` and initialize it to be empty.
