# Github Tutorial

Oh no!
The title of this page contains a typo.
Instead of `Tutrial`, it should say `Tutorial`.
Fortunately, since this project is hosted on github,
you can use git to fix this mistake for me.

Follow the 5 step procedure in the figure below to submit a pull request that fixes this typo.

**NOTE:**
If you would like more detailed written instructions, you can follow [this seven step procedure](https://jarv.is/notes/how-to-pull-request-fork-github/).
This procedure has 2 extra steps in it in order to make it a bit more robust.
We will cover the purpose of these 2 extra steps in later weeks.

Since everyone is submitting the same pull request for an intentionally made typo,
I will not accept your pull requests.
But, if you ever find typos in this repo, please submit a pull request.
I will accept the pull request and give you extra credit.
Then everyone will have the benefit of having the typo fixed.
