## Lecture

We will cover how to

1. work on a remote unix server
1. use the git version control system
1. use continuous integration to "prove" that your code works

**Prelecture Work:**

Watch this video:

1. [What is Git and GitHub?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUuTYDg9XoI)

Print each of these cheatsheets, and have them handy for lecture:

1. [bash](https://files.fosswire.com/2007/08/fwunixref.pdf)
1. [vim](https://github.com/mikeizbicki/ucr-cs100/blob/class-template/textbook/cheatsheets/vim-cheatsheet.pdf)
1. [git](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf)
1. [github pull requests](pull_request.png)

## Lab

**Due Date:**

Labs are always due on midnight of the Sunday of the week that they are assigned (i.e. January 31 for this lab).
If you either attend the class lab session or collaborate with another student by completing the lab together over zoom, then you get a 48 hour extension until the following Tuesday at midnight (i.e. February 2 for this lab).

Weekly homeworks have the same due dates and extension policies.


**Pre-lab work:**

1. Create a GitHub account if you do not already have one.
   Log in, and press the "watch" button at the top of this page.
   Read and follow the instructions in [the meet and greet issue](https://github.com/mikeizbicki/cmc-csci046/issues/137).

1. Log in to the lambda server.
   Run the command
   ```
   $ vimtutor
   ```
   Complete all instructions in order to learn vim.
   This should take 30-60 minutes.

1. (Optional)
   Play the https://vim-adventures.com game to learn vim while playing a game.
   The first 3 levels are free, but you have to pay to continue playing the game.
   Anyone who completes the entire game gets +1 point extra credit.

**Instructions:**

1. Run the command
   ```
   $ typespeed
   ```
   to test your unix typing skills.
   Programmers spend lots of time at the keyboard,
   and so it pays to actually be able to type well.
   Anyone who beats my top score gets +0.1 point extra credit and my undying admiration.

1. Complete the [unix/git tutorial](git.md)
1. Follow [these instructions](lambda-server.md) to update your lambda server account's settings
1. Complete the [github pull request assignment](github.md)

**Lab Submission:**

Submit a link to your pull request in sakai.
(I need the link since your github usernames are pseudonymous, and I won't know who to give credit for the lab without the link.)
