   Install linux on your computer and use it exclusively throughout the semester (not just for this class, but for all your computing).

   You must install linux before February 14th to get this extra credit.

   You cannot use a virtual machine.

   Dual booting is acceptable as long as you only use the original operating system for "emergency" purposes, and spend >95% of your computing time in linux.

   I personally use Debian linux on all my machines.
   Ubuntu is another popular distribution.
   It's based on Debian but has a few usability enhancements and what [the Free Software Foundation (and Richard Stallman in particular) calls "spyware"](https://linux.slashdot.org/story/12/12/07/1527225/rms-speaks-out-against-ubuntu).
